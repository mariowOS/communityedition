# Community-backed development of mariowOS
This is the repository for the community edition event of mariowOS.

### How do i partecipate?
First you have to fork this repository and then you can modify the files you want to edit. After you have done that you can send a pull request with your commit documented in this way:
- Title: [what you did]
- Description: [what you did but more documented]

### Whats the point of this version?
More than see what you all can cook out, it's a way for me to see where can mariowOS improve by seeing the fixes you all have done to this version. I will keep it updated with mainstream fixes (new kernel, new Tiles fixes and more).
